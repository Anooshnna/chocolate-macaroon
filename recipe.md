1.Sift together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt and almond meal.

2.Place the almond flour mixture into a food processor and pulse 8-10 times

3.Whip your egg whites until frothy with the whisk attachment then slowly add in your granulated sugar while mixing on low.

4.Continue mixing until the egg whites become white and you can see some lines being made in the meringue. Add in your cream of tartar.

5.Whip until soft glossy peaks form.

6.Continue whipping on medium-high until the meringue is at stiff peaks.

7.Add in 1/3 of your almond mixture and fold by taking your spatula and going around the edge of the bowl just under the batter, then cut through the center. Repeat this until you don’t see any dry spots.

8.Place your spatula flat on top of the batter and turn the bowl to knock out some of the air from the batter.

9.Once your batter falls from the spatula in a ribbon, try and draw a figure 8. If the batter doesn’t break, it’s ready. You will also notice the edges of the batter begin to turn glossy and the mixture oozes very slowly. The ribbon should dissolve back into the batter after about 20 seconds.

10.Place the piping bag into a cup while you pour in the batter.

11.Now you can pipe your macarons onto your parchment paper and bake

12.Lift your tray up about 5 inches and drop onto the table to pop any bubbles that are under the surface of your macaron and the batter should spread to the edge of the circle.

13.Let your macaron sit at room temperature until a crust forms over the surface. Depending on your room, it can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours. You should be able to touch the top lightly and it doesn’t feel sticky.
